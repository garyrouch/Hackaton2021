# ITC Hackaton September 2021

A Python scrapper to retrieve and store information about jobs available on Indeed.
This scrapper is part of ITC project.

## Description 

As part of ITC, a data science bootcamp. I participated to a 24 hours hackaton with the theme: Gaming for good. 

We developped a game where zombies come at players holding pannels with mails written on them and the player have to shoot the zombies if the mail they are holding is a spam. 

Us, the datascience section of the team, developped a model predicting is a mail is a spam or not. We then used the models to make predictions on some of the mails database we were able to find in order to create a MySQL database that could be requested by the full stack students that were developping the design of the game.
